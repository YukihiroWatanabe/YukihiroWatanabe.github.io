# YukihiroWatanabe.github.io

Visual explanations of **Nakano-style Associatron** and related associative-memory dynamics:
cue → competition → convergence (recall), with diagrams and small runnable demos.

This repository is written as a technical notebook for:
- understanding associative memory as **dynamics** (not “lookup”)
- building small, reproducible demos (HTML / JS)
- documenting historical references with a calm, source-first style

## What is “Associatron” (Nakano, 1972)?

Kaoru Nakano proposed “Associatron” as an associative memory model that can
store patterns and reconstruct a whole from a part (content-addressable recall).
A canonical reference is:

- K. Nakano, “Associatron—A Model of Associative Memory,” IEEE Trans. SMC, 1972.  
  (See bibliographic entries: DBLP / CiNii)

## What this site is (and is not)

**This site is:**
- a set of visual notes and runnable toy implementations
- focused on *mechanism*: cue injection → context/room competition → recall
- written to be readable without heavy math

**This site is not:**
- a ranking or “credit war” page
- a critique campaign against any named model or community
- a comprehensive survey (it stays narrow and reproducible)
