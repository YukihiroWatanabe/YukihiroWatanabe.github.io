Visual explanations of **Nakano-style Associatron** and related associative-memory dynamics:
cue → competition → convergence (recall), with diagrams and small runnable demos.

This repository is written as a technical notebook for:
- understanding associative memory as **dynamics** (not “lookup”)
- building small, reproducible demos (HTML / JS)
- documenting historical references with a calm, source-first style

## What is “Associatron” (Nakano, 1972)?

Kaoru Nakano proposed “Associatron” as an associative memory model that can
store patterns and reconstruct a whole from a part (content-addressable recall).
A canonical reference is:

- K. Nakano, “Associatron—A Model of Associative Memory,” IEEE Trans. SMC, 1972.  
  (See bibliographic entries: DBLP / CiNii)

## What this site is (and is not)

**This site is:**
- a set of visual notes and runnable toy implementations
- focused on *mechanism*: cue injection → context/room competition → recall
- written to be readable without heavy math

**This site is not:**
- a ranking or “credit war” page
- a critique campaign against any named model or community
- a comprehensive survey (it stays narrow and reproducible)

## Development Note

This project was developed through extensive iterative discussions with AI tools (ChatGPT and Grok).

The process was not a one-way code generation workflow.  
Many parts were refined through repeated trial, disagreement, correction, and redesign.

The AI systems were used as thinking partners, while all architectural direction, integration decisions, and final judgments were made by the author.

This repository reflects that collaborative and exploratory development process.

## Research Note

This repository is a research and educational demonstration of associative memory dynamics (Nakano-style Associatron).

External inputs (mouse / camera) are treated as **perturbations (initial conditions)**.  
The recalled state emerges from internal competition and convergence, rather than from explicit commands.
